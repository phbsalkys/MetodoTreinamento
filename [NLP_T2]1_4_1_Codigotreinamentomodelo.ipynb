        "\n",
        "Para apresentar uma visão geral do processo de treinamento do modelo desenvolvido com Gemma, iniciamos destacando que Gemma faz parte de uma família de modelos de linguagem grande (LLMs) de última geração, beneficiando-se das pesquisas e tecnologias empregadas nos modelos Gemini. Estes modelos são reconhecidos por sua eficácia em várias tarefas de Processamento de Linguagem Natural (NLP), graças a um processo de pré-treinamento auto-supervisionado em extensos corpus textuais. Este pré-treinamento permite que os LLMs adquiram conhecimentos de uso geral, identificando relações estatísticas entre palavras.\n",
        "\n",
        "Para ajustar esses modelos a tarefas específicas de domínio, como a análise de sentimentos, adotamos técnicas que não requerem a atualização de todos os bilhões de parâmetros. Uma dessas técnicas é a [Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685), que minimiza o número de parâmetros treináveis para tarefas subsequentes, fixando os pesos originais do modelo e introduzindo um número reduzido de novos pesos. Essa abordagem não apenas agiliza o processo de treinamento e o torna mais eficiente em termos de uso da memória, mas também resulta em modelos mais leves, com os pesos finais ocupando apenas algumas centenas de megabytes, sem comprometer a qualidade do modelo.\n",
        "\n",
        "Para acomodar o uso limitado da GPU gratuita disponível, o período de treinamento e outros parâmetros foram ajustados para otimizar o uso dos recursos. Assim, o modelo foi treinado por apenas 3 épocas com um tamanho de batch de 1 sobre o [conjunto de dados Databricks Dolly 15k](https://huggingface.co/datasets/databricks/databricks-dolly-15k). Este conjunto, composto por 15.000 pares de prompt/resposta de alta qualidade gerados por humanos, concebidos para otimizar o ajuste fino de LLMs."

Tracing is expensive and the excessive number of tracings could be due to (1) creating @tf.function repeatedly in a loop, (2) passing tensors with different shapes, (3) passing Python objects instead of tensors. For (1), please define your @tf.function outside of the loop. For (2), @tf.function has reduce_retracing=True option that can avoid unnecessary retracing. For (3), please refer to https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/function#controlling_retracing and https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/function for  more details.\n"
